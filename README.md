PowerCoach Styles

This is a first time use of github and to make things interesting its also the first time using LESS. I am working on a Mac with the gui version of github and bbEdit 9.6.3 as the text editor. 

The PowerCoach project uses css colors across a wordpress theme (TwentyTwelve child). Things were getting too complicated so decided to use variable names for the colors. 

Components will comprise an HTML output file t0 example stylesheet the theme posting features. There will also be a WordPress "plugin" with short-codes to make it easier for the user to use the colors and features.

There are some BootStrap inspired elements like .wells and .buttons however this is not a BootStrap project at the moment.
